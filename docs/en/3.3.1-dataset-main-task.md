We provide an overview of the BANZSL-FS benchmark tasks and their corresponding evaluation metrics:

<br>

### **Isolated Fingerspelling Recognition (IFSR)**

Given a segmented fingerspelling clip the goal of IFSR is to transcribe it into the corresponding letter sequence.

**Evaluation Metric**: **Letter Accuracy**
Defined as:

$$
1 - \frac{\text{EditDistance}(L^*, \hat{L})}{|L^*|},
$$

where $L^*$ is the ground-truth letter sequence and $\hat{L}$ is the predicted sequence.
This edit-distance-based metric captures correctness, accounting for insertions, deletions, and substitutions.

### **Fingerspelling Detection (FSD)**

Given an untrimmed sign language video with $T$ frames, the goal of FSD is to identify temporal segments $(f_s, f_e)$ that localize fingerspelling intervals within $\mathbb{V}$.

**Evaluation Metric**: **AP@IoU**
- Average Precision is calculated based on temporal Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between predicted and ground-truth segments.
- Higher IoU thresholds reflect stricter localization accuracy.

---
<br>
### **Fingerspelling Detection followed by Recognition (FSD-R)**

This is a two-stage approach:
1. An FSD model predicts temporal segments from an untrimmed sign language video.
2. Each predicted segment is processed by a fingerspelling recognizer to generate the corresponding letter sequence.

**Evaluation Metric**: **AP@Acc**
- Average Precision is computed using the **accuracy of the recognizer** on each predicted segment.
- A prediction is considered correct if its **recognition accuracy exceeds a defined threshold**, ensuring that detected segments are not only well-localized but also **interpretable**.

### **Fingerspelling Recognition in Context (FSR-Context)**

Given a full sentence-level sign language video $\mathbb{V}$ and its predicted spoken language translation $\hat{T}$,
the task is to evaluate how accurately the model transcribes **fingerspelled terms embedded in the sentence**.

Fingerspelled spans annotated in the video are aligned with corresponding spans in $\hat{T}$, and **character-level accuracy** is measured.

**Evaluation Metric**: **Letter Accuracy**
